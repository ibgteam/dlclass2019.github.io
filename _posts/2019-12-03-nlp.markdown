## Interpreting the State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing Models


### What is Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Process (NLP) is a computerized approach to analyze and represent naturally occurring texts for the purpose of achieving human-like language processing. In the era of big data, Natural Language Processing has witnessed a variety of applications that include but not limited to

* Machine Translation 
* Interactive Voice Response
* Grammar Checking
* Sentiment Analysis

In the blog, we provide a simple introduction to Natural Language Processing that covers common techniques of processing text data and modern applications of deep learning models in NLP.
